# my-portafolio-boostrap
Hi, I'm Monica, **Monica-tech75** in github. Is one year now that I start learning **Web development** by myself and 
even if sometimes it's feel hard I'm enjoying what I'm learning.
This year I gona try to find a course or a bootcamp where I can met people and share this passion for coding. 
This is my first Portafolio where I work with Boostrap.
